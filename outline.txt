# NOVEM

BLUF: Swap out dotfiles with sym or hardlinks, 
      put dots in central place, trackable with git.
      Make this super easy.

config opts:
    config / data dir     where novem puts its data
    zip path?             where to put zipped dotfiles when ZIP argument is called
                        (unpack is the opposite of this)
                        this might not matter too much with cloud stuff and autouplinks
                        but still

flags:
    -v, -vv, -vvv             level of verbosity? i.e., datestamps
    
    -h, --help     {arg}      print help of function if there is an argument, or print all help

    -d, --diff                returns list of dots that have been changed
          diff args  {days (default), months - "-d 3m" is diff from past 3 months}

    -a, --all                 ? is this useful?
    -r, --recursive           ? replace with subdir?

// search by file name or inode
// file hashes ? when something has been moved

$ novem     |  puts    |   {file path(s)}   -> logs new dotfile
            |          |   -d, --diff    -> updates all dotfiles that have been changed since last log
            |
            |
            |  list    |   {optional search param}  -> prints all logged dotfiles
            |          |   -d, --diff              -> not actually any different than diff flag by itself
            |
            |  remove  |   {file path, search}      -> cuts this dotfile from logs
            |
            |
            |  zipto   |   {optional zip output path}   -> zips dotfiles to location if specified, uses config if not
            |
            |
            |  unpack  |   {optional zip input path}    -> tries to unzip all dotfiles to their logged paths
